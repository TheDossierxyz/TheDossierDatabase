Why you must use this specific example:
In your README, explicitly point out these 4 things to your contributors so they understand why the schema is built this way:

The processed_by tag: Show them exactly where their alias goes so they get credit for the batch.

The [REDACTED
] Rule: Explain that they cannot create a "Self-Loop" (Lesley emailing Lesley). If the recipient is blacked out, they must use [REDACTED
].

The "Implied Entity" Rule: Point out that even though the mom doesn't have a name,
"Maxim's mom" is a critical entity to track.

The quote Rule: Emphasize that Neo4j will reject their submission if they don't provide the exact text snippet to prove the connection.
