Giving contributors credit is the engine that keeps open-source and crowdsourced projects alive. However, since you are operating anonymously, you must design a system where credit is tracked automatically and real identities are protected.

To do this, we will build a Two-Tier Tracking System.

The Micro Level: The contributor's alias is permanently attached to the specific document in your Neo4j database.

The Macro Level: GitHub automatically generates a "Hall of Fame" file that your website can display.

Here is exactly how to set this up.

Tier 1: The "Digital Signature" (Database Tracking)
We want your Neo4j database to know exactly who processed which file. This allows you to add a badge on your website that says "Digitized by @ShadowCoder" at the bottom of every document.

Step 1: Update the Miner Script (dossier_miner.py)
Tell your volunteers to add their chosen alias to their .env file:

Ini, TOML
GEMINI_API_KEY=their_api_key_here
CONTRIBUTOR_HANDLE=ShadowCoder
Then, update your Python miner script to read this handle and inject it into the meta block of the JSON:

Python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
CONTRIBUTOR = os.getenv("CONTRIBUTOR_HANDLE", "Anonymous")

# ... inside your JSON generation logic ...
json_data["meta"]["processed_by"] = CONTRIBUTOR
