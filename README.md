# The Dossier Database

**A decentralized, community-driven knowledge graph of public interest data.**

Our mission is to convert unstructured documents (PDFs, emails, reports) into a structured graph database (Neo4j) that anyone can query.

## 📂 Project Structure

*   `data/raw_batches/`: Source documents waiting to be processed.
*   `data/processed/`: Structured JSON files extracted by contributors.
*   `src/`: Tools for mining and validation.
*   `schema.json`: The "Ironclad" contract that defines our data structure.

## 🤖 Supported AI Models

We require high-intelligence models to ensure data accuracy.

*   **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** (Default)
*   **OpenAI GPT-4o**
*   **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet**
